= Running Tests

Tests are run from the project root directory.  But are run in the context of the dummy app located under test/dummy.  In order to run the tests you must first setup dummy app database.

cd test/dummy; rake db:setup; rake test:prepare

Once you have done this cd to the project root and run the following:

rake spec
rake cucumber
