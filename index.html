          <p>Tim is a Rails Engine responsible for Cloud image management.  It
allows clients to create, delete and upload images to a multitude of
Cloud providers.  Tim builds on top of Imagefactoryâ€™s cloud
abstraction layer.</p>

<p>Adding the ability for clients to store meta-data (used for searching
and sorting) as well as versioning and support for access control.
Tim wraps all this up in a clean, simply RESTful API.</p>

<p>You can read the full presentation <a href="http://www.aeolusproject.org/docs/presentations/2012-nov-conference/tim.odp">here</a>.</p>

<h2>Configuration</h2>

<h3>Securing Image Factory requests</h3>

<p>It is possible to secure Image Factory requests using 2 Legged OAuth.  To use 2
Legged OAuth you must set the OAuth consumer key, consumer secret and url in the
Tim::ImageFactory::Base.config.</p>

<h4>Example:</h4>

<div class="highlight"><pre>  <span class="n">oauth_config</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">{</span><span class="ss">:consumer_key</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="s2">"mock-key"</span><span class="p">,</span>
                  <span class="ss">:consumer_secret</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="s2">"mock-secret"</span><span class="p">,</span>
                  <span class="ss">:site</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="s2">"http://localhost:8075/imagefactory/"</span><span class="p">}</span>
  <span class="ss">Tim</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="ss">:ImageFactory</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="no">Base</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">config</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">oauth_config</span>
</pre></div>

<h2>Running Tests</h2>

<p><a href="http://travis-ci.org/aeolus-incubator/tim%5D"><img src="https://secure.travis-ci.org/aeolus-incubator/tim.png" alt="Build Status"></a></p>

<p>Tests are run from the project root directory.  But are run in the
context of the dummy app located under test/dummy.  In order to run
the tests you must first setup dummy app database.</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre>  <span class="n">rake</span> <span class="ss">db</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="n">setup</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="n">rake</span> <span class="o">-</span><span class="n">f</span> <span class="nb">test</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">dummy</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="no">Rakefile</span> <span class="nb">test</span><span class="ss">:prepare</span>
</pre></div>

<p>Once you have done this cd to the project root and run the following:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre>  <span class="n">rake</span> <span class="n">spec</span>
</pre></div>

<h2>Running the Dummy app</h2>

<p>This will allow you to runn the commands below to test out the engine
in isolation (if mounted in another application, the main difference
will just be where the engine gets mounted, so adjust your url
accordingly).</p>

<p>cd test/dummy; rails s</p>

<h2>Generating State Machines Images</h2>

<p>From test/dummy run:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre>  <span class="n">rake</span> <span class="n">state_machine</span><span class="ss">:draw</span> <span class="no">FILE</span><span class="o">=.</span><span class="n">.</span><span class="o">/.</span><span class="n">.</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">app</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">models</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">tim</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">target_image</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">rb</span> <span class="no">CLASS</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="ss">Tim</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="ss">:TargetImage</span>
  <span class="n">rake</span> <span class="n">state_machine</span><span class="ss">:draw</span> <span class="no">FILE</span><span class="o">=.</span><span class="n">.</span><span class="o">/.</span><span class="n">.</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">app</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">models</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">tim</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">provider_image</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">rb</span> <span class="no">CLASS</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="ss">Tim</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="ss">:ProviderImage</span>
</pre></div>

<h2>Contributing</h2>

<p>We encourage you to contribute to Tim.  We are open to new ideas and
features (especially if you offer to implement them!) as well as
{Github issues}[<a href="https://github.com/aeolus-incubator/tim/issues/">https://github.com/aeolus-incubator/tim/issues/</a>] to point
us at any bugs that may be encountered.</p>

<h3>General</h3>

<ul>
<li>We use {Github issues}[<a href="https://github.com/aeolus-incubator/tim/issues/">https://github.com/aeolus-incubator/tim/issues/</a>]
to track our features and bugs.</li>
<li>Want to paste some code or output? Put ``` on a line above and
below your code/output. See {Github documentation's}[<a href="https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown">https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown</a>]
<b>Fenced Code Blocks</b> for details.</li>
<li>Please use {pull requests}[<a href="https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests">https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests</a>]
to submit code, whether for implementation of a new feature or for a bug fix.</li>
<li>If you submit a pull request that doesn't have a test to go with it
there is less chance we will merge it.</li>
</ul><h3>Features</h3>

<p>Have an idea for a feature you want to implement (or would like us to
consider implementing when time allows)?  Simply submit a new
issue[<a href="https://github.com/aeolus-incubator/tim/issues/">https://github.com/aeolus-incubator/tim/issues/</a>] describing the
feature in sufficient detail to enable someone to consider
implementing it.  Ideally this would be in a format focusing on:</p>

<ul>
<li>Who would be the user of this feature?</li>
<li>How would the feature be used (this could be a workflow, api
example, etc)?</li>
<li>What need does it fill (in other words, why does the user want/need
to do the described task)?</li>
</ul><p>If you like, you may use the Connextra format, but it is not strictly
required.  For reference, that format is:</p>

<p><em>In order to [benefit], a [stakeholder] wants to [feature].</em></p>

<h3>Bug Reporting</h3>

<p>While we always strive to not have bug, we realize they will come up,
and appreciate help in identifying them so they can be corrected. If
you believe you have found such a thing, please tell us:</p>

<ul>
<li>which version of Tim you're using</li>
<li>which version of Ruby you're using.</li>
<li>How to reproduce it. Bugs with a failing test in a
{pull request}[<a href="https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests">https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests</a>] get
extra points, though a description and stack trace, if appropriate,
would be a minimum requirement for the issue to receive attention.
(And of course, submitting a pull request with proper tests that also
fixes the bug will get the fix in a release quicker yet!)</li>
